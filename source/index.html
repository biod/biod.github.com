<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/biod/BioD" target="_blank">BioD</a> is an open source software library  for analysis of 
biological sequence and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_throughput_biology" target="_blank">high-throughput data</a> generated in genomics and life-sciences written using the <a href="https://dlang.org/" target="_blank" >D programming language.</a> BioD provides a platform for developing fast and efficient bioinformatics applications used for processing high-throughput biological data and manipulating common bioinformatics file formats. BioD tries to avoid heap allocations and tasks are parallelized to take advantage of available CPUs. The current code base provides
efficient native processing of BAM files, a convinient alphabet and an  abstraction for representing biological sequence data.
</p>

<h4>Why D?</h4>
<p>
D is a compiled multi-paradigm systems programming  language that emphasizes memory safety, correctness and offers the same speed and effieciency as C/C++ and a reputation for fast code compilation.
The LDC or GDC compilers provide some of the most efficient and fast binaries, in addition, the LDC compiler provides  <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/Cross-compiling_with_LDC">implicit cross-compilation.</a> 
Futhermore GDC  will be included as part of the GCC compiler. 
</p>

<h4>Unit tests</h4>
<p>
Every non-trivial algorithm in the library is covered by unittests, which can be easily run from the command line (see below).

Whenever you find out that something doesn't work correctly, please report an issue, and the test suite will grow once it's fixed!
</p>

<h4>Compiling</h4>
<p>
A <a href="https://dlang.org/download.html" target="_blank">recent D compiler</a> is required to work with BioD. BioD is supported on 
Linux and Macos platforms. It has not been tested on the  Windows platform.

    <h2>Obtaining BioD</h2>

Download the source code

{% codeblock %}

$ git clone https://github.com/biod/BioD.git
$ cd BioD/test
$ rdmd -I.. -unittest unittests.d

{% endcodeblock %}

Run the examples
```
$ cd ../examples
$ rdmd -I.. example1.d
$ dmd -I.. -i example1.d // compile an example
$ ./example1 //run the compiled binary
```

<h4>Building</h4>
<p>
BioD can be built using the make file as well as using the meson build. 
</p>

<h4>Installing using the DUB package manager</h4>
<p>
BioD is <a href="https://code.dlang.org/search?q=BioD" target="_blank">available</a> via the  <a href="https://code.dlang.org/getting_started" target="_blank">dub package</a> registry. This makes it easy to include BioD as a dependency for your D bioinformatics project. Follow the instructions on working with dub.
